      <li>
        <strong>GENERAL SAFETY PRINCIPLES</strong><br />
        The Company is firmly committed to promoting a safe, compliant, and hazard-minimized work environment across all operational and delivery activities. Safety is recognized not only as a regulatory obligation but also as a core corporate responsibility. All equipment and materials supplied or rented by the Company are subject to routine checks, condition verification, and compliance assessments in accordance with industry standards and statutory requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES</strong><br />
        Upon delivery, the Customer assumes full responsibility for the safe handling, storage, operation, and supervision of the equipment and materials. The Customer warrants that all operators or personnel involved in the use of the equipment are qualified, appropriately trained, and competent under applicable laws and safety protocols. The Customer further acknowledges that the Company is not responsible for any operational errors, misuse, negligent conduct, or non-compliance on site resulting from the Customer’s failure to implement or enforce adequate safety measures.<br />
        It shall be the duty of the Customer to ensure that all necessary personal protective equipment (PPE), barricading, signage, and warning systems are in place and observed throughout the duration of use. The Customer shall also be responsible for complying with site-specific safety norms and the rules prescribed by the relevant local authorities, labor departments, and environmental regulators.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>EQUIPMENT SAFETY AND CONDITION</strong><br />
        All rental equipment is inspected and serviced at regular intervals in accordance with manufacturer guidelines and applicable regulatory frameworks. A comprehensive pre-dispatch inspection is conducted to ensure mechanical fitness, operational integrity, and absence of safety hazards. Upon delivery, the Customer shall inspect the equipment and report any visible defects, inconsistencies, or deficiencies immediately. Failure to report such concerns within twenty-four (24) hours of delivery shall be deemed acceptance of the equipment in good working and safe condition.<br />
        The Company does not permit modification, disassembly, or unauthorized repair of any equipment provided. In the event of mechanical failure, damage, or suspected risk, the Customer shall immediately cease operation and notify the Company for further guidance or replacement, as applicable. Continued use of malfunctioning or damaged equipment is strictly prohibited and shall constitute a breach of contract and indemnifiable act.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>MATERIAL HANDLING AND TRANSPORT</strong><br />
        The Company ensures that all construction materials, including aggregates, steel, cement, and other building products, are packaged, loaded, and transported in compliance with the safety regulations applicable to logistics and road transport. The Customer is required to inspect the condition of the materials upon delivery and to unload and store them in a safe and secure manner, free from risk of structural compromise, environmental exposure, or contamination.<br />
        Any mechanical assistance used during unloading (such as cranes, forklifts, or hoists) must be operated by licensed and experienced personnel. The Company shall not be liable for injuries, damages, or losses arising out of improper handling of materials by the Customer or its agents.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ACCIDENT REPORTING AND INCIDENT ESCALATION</strong><br />
        In the event of any accident, injury, fire, spillage, structural collapse, equipment malfunction, or other hazardous event, the Customer shall immediately initiate site-level emergency protocols and notify the Company without delay. A formal written incident report shall be submitted to the Company within forty-eight (48) hours, detailing the nature of the incident, causes (if known), actions taken, and personnel affected.<br />
        The Company may, at its discretion, investigate such incidents, suspend further services at the site, or require the implementation of corrective measures as a condition for resuming service. Cooperation with Company safety officers, auditors, or legal representatives during such investigations is mandatory.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND STANDARDS</strong><br />
        The Customer agrees to comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and codes of practice, including but not limited to the Factories Act, 1948, the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996, and any local or state-specific construction safety regulations. Non-compliance with such laws or failure to adhere to required safety practices shall constitute a material breach of the service agreement and may result in termination of service and legal liability.<br />
        The Company shall not be liable for any penal actions, site shutdowns, or enforcement proceedings arising from the Customer’s failure to comply with such statutory obligations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>LIMITATION OF COMPANY LIABILITY</strong><br />
        The Company shall not be held liable for any death, personal injury, property damage, environmental loss, or economic harm arising from on-site incidents, unsafe handling, or misuse of equipment or materials, unless such harm is directly attributable to the Company’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Company disclaims all liability for third-party claims or disputes arising from the Customer’s failure to observe safety regulations, operational protocols, or contractual obligations.<br />
        The Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors, agents, and employees from and against all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, costs, and expenses, including legal fees, arising out of any breach of safety obligations, negligence, misconduct, or violation of law attributable to the Customer or its personnel.
      </li>
      <li>

Any such modifications shall be deemed effective upon being published on the official website or communicated through formal written means.
